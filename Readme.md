# Usage

## Development Mode

To run the application in development mode with automatic transpilation and server restart:

```bash
  npm run dev
```

This command uses `ts-node-dev` to watch for changes in the `src` directory, transpile TypeScript files, and restart the server.

## Production Mode

To build the project for production:

```bash
  npm run build
```

This command uses the TypeScript compiler `tsc` to transpile the TypeScript code into JavaScript. The compiled code is output to the `dist` directory.

To start the application in production mode:

```bash
  npm start:dev
```

## Code Linting

To lint the code using `ESLint`:

```bash
  npm run lint
```

To automatically fix linting issues:

```bash
  npm run lint:fix
```
